### Material Requirements
#### 1. Ensure your laptop is up to the task of coding specified in the [Code Fellows Material Requirements](https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-201/foundations-of-software-development/#material-requirements)

- 64-bit Operating System, like macOS or Windows 10
- Fully up to date, with the latest version of the operating system and all security updates installed
- At least 50GB of free space on the hard drive
- At least 8GB of RAM. 16GB RAM strongly preferred

- Can reliably connect to wireless networks

 
#### 2. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

> ###### *CODE 101 DOES NOT COVER YOUR COMPUTER SETUP FOR 201. MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE ENTIRE SETUP GUIDE FOR YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM - Graduates of code 102 will have completed this computer setup step.* 

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)
  - [Windows 10](prework/windows/01_preface.md)
  - [Ubuntu Linux(if you do not have Windows 10 or Mac OS)](prework/ubuntu/1_terminal.md)

#### By the time you’ve completed the guide, you should be able to run the following commands in your terminal, and have each report a version number of what’s installed (should look *similar* to below example).
